Rails and Google Mail

December 19, 2008

Configuring Ruby on Rails to use Gmail's SMTP server to send outbound email from your website can be tricky.

Connecting on port 25 does not work, we'll have to use port 587 and TLS (a version of SSL). To enable TLS in Rails we have to install action_mailer_tls plugin.

script/plugin install http://code.openrain.com/rails/action_mailer_tls/

↓ output ↓

+ ./README
+ ./init.rb
+ ./lib/smtp_tls.rb
+ ./sample/mailer.yml.sample
+ ./sample/smtp_gmail.rb

Copy files mailer.yml.sample and smtp_gmail.rb into config/initializers directory.

Rename file mailer.yml.sample into mailer.yml. Update file with your credentials. Notice that we are using port 587 and plain authentication.
mailer.yml

--- 
  :address: smtp.gmail.com
  :port: 587
  :user_name: email@dress.com
  :password: h@ckme
  :authentication: :plain

The newly copied smtp_gmail.rb will be executed when server starts and will load mail.yml to setup ActionMailer.
smtp_gmail.rb

require "smtp_tls"

mailer_config = File.open("#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/mailer.yml") 
mailer_options = YAML.load(mailer_config) 
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = mailer_options 

Another thing to keep in mind, is that there's a limit of 500 messages per day
